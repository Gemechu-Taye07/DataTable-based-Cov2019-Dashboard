# DataTable-based-Cov2019-Dashboard
The project is a piece of Covid19 live information based on DataTable for local city's and states in the remote country for those, not access to updates on the Global API datasets.    The DataTables will fetch update's from Google Spreadsheet. the best example for the project I'm looking to do https://ncov2019.live/
